## Future Integration with React
If you plan to integrate this landing page into a React application, here are the steps you might consider:

1. Create a New React App:
- npx create-react-app my-app
- cd my-app
2. Integrate Existing Markup: Convert the HTML markup into a React component format, such as turning the login form into a LoginForm component.
3. CSS to JSX Styling: Convert the CSS into CSS Modules or consider using styled-components for a more component-centric approach.
4. State Management: Manage the form's state using React's state hooks (e.g., useState) or context for more complex states.
5. Routing: Implement routing with React Router to navigate between pages seamlessly.
6. Deployment: Once your application is ready, deploy it using platforms like Vercel or Netlify.
